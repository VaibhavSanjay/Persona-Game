Arcana Bot Guide (By Corporate-Bot)
Here is a (hopefully) helpful guide to help you get the full use out of this bot.
Creating a Character
This is pretty easy. Using the command `rp!createchar` will get the bot to ask you a few questions in order to create your data. Before you use this command, be sure to have a description and a picture of your character handy! You can always use this command to reset your character again. Use `rp!allplayers` to get a list of all of the players who have created a character.
Viewing Your Stats
To view your stats, you can use `rp!stats`. This command also allows you to view the stats of others. For example, writing `rp!stats rin`, `rp!stats rin akagi`, or `rp!stats @Corporate-Bot` will allow you to view my character. If you would like to view someone's character, keep it in one of those forms. Viewing your stats will show basic information such as name and arcana, but will also show valuable info such as your stats for things such as SAP and END as well as ranks such as Knowledge and Charm. These stats will update as you level up, and they are stored on a database (safe and sound <:SmileChamp:587464108799033355>)
Checking Out the Libraries
Forgot how much damage one of your attacks did or even what it does? The library of attacks is also stored on this bot. You can search for all the attacks of an element(ex: `rp!library elec`) or for a specific attack (ex: `rp!library ice cleave`). You may also check out the stats for having a certain level (`rp!lvlstats`) or the stats for having a certain amount of points for something such as SAP (`rp!ptstats`). The last option for stats is `rp!rankstats` and this will give you the amount of rank points required to level up in rank. This information is not available to the players and only for *mods* so it sends info through DMs only to them. (When I say mod, I am referring to Eurae because he manages the game, and me because I sometimes have to debug this ~~dumbo~~ bot :sweat:)
Leveling Up
For this game, it is the player's responsibility to manage the amount of current HP, SP, yen, items, and EXP they have (This bot can't do everything!). Using `rp!stats`, you can check to see how much EXP you need to reach the next level. Once you have reached this threshhold, you should follow these steps: 1. Use `rp!reqlvl` to add yourself to the request list for gaining levels. You can't just add levels to yourself as Eurae must approve. 2. Eurae looks at the request list and approves of your level up. You may also view this request list using the command `rp!reqlist`. Once he approves it, Eurae will use the command `rp!lvlup <user>` in order to level you up. 3. Your request will be removed from the list. It's as simple as that. That's all there is to leveling up!
Visiting the Shops
After you have been in a shop in the roleplay, you will be allowed to visit that shop again. Use the command `rp!shops` to look at all the shops in the area. Keep in mind that you can only visit shops that you have *already visited*. You can also use `rp!shops <name>` to search for a specific shop. If you find something in the shop that you want to buy, please use the command `rp!reqshop <item1> <item2> ...` to buy all the items you list. These items will appear after using `rp!reqlist` and will appear listed along with level requests. Eurae may delete all of these shopping requests when he wants.
Searching and Adding Links
I noticed that there are a lot of important links that are related to the roleplay, so I decided to make a command that can store them all. Use `rp!addlink <link> <name>` to add a link to the bot to store it. Using `rp!search <keyword1> <keyword2>...` will allow you to search for these links again. If you have a link that you post, consider adding it to the bot as it only takes a few seconds. :smile: You may also display all of the links used by the bot using `rp!linklist`. If you find that a link is unnecessary, you could delete it using `rp!removelink <ID>`. The ID can be found by searching the link.
Final Notes
If you have any issues or questions, or if you find any bugs in the bot please do not hesitate to @ me. I might be away because of something or the other but I will get back to ASAP! :wink: Thank you for being supportive and using this bot,          *Corporate-Bot*

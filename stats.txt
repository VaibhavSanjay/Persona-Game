Okashi Kotsugai
In her younger years, Okashi’s father and mother opened a confectionery store in Fukuoka, Japan. The business was extremely successful and had a very easy upbringing. She went to the most prestigious schools and got her own brand of sweets that was made entirely by her called, Angel’s Kiss. Though they weren’t nearly as popular as her parents sweets, they still sold well. As the business expanded, soon they were looking to export their product to foreign lands and assumed the best start would be with China. As it grew they needed more workers, and China offered many to help the prospering business. Suddenly, Okashi's mother divorced her father and planned to take everything by faking domestic abuse. Okashi was taken from her father and she planned to flea to China and marry one of their business partners. Okashi was able to escape right before she left for China and eventually found her father. After they reunited, she decided to stay with him and try to rebuild their destroyed reputation.

Hazama
Hazama was created by Relius Clover to be the vessel for Yūki Terumi in case after the loss of his predecessor vessel Kazuma Kval during the Great Dark War. However, due to side effects of the mind eater curse their merge was incomplete which forced them to remain separate entities sharing the same body, and worked alongside the 7th Agency and Relius Clover to create Mu-12, a Murakumo Unit designed to become a heart for a new Black Beast that the 7th Agency desired to destroy the Control Organization. Hazama, who has the original Blue Grimoire, sought to fuse with Mu to become the Black Beast’s body; however, this plan was thwarted by the Takamagahara who subsequently fired Highlander: Takemikazuchi upon the 5th Hierarchical City of Ibukido, decimating the city into what was soon known as the “Burning Fields of Ikaruga”. Mu’s smelting process was halted and she was later adopted and christened as Noel Vermillion who was actually the master unit possessing Mu.In battle, Hazama wields, Balisong-style butterfly knives for close-range attacks, along with having hidden knives that stick out of his shoes’ heels.Hazama is incredibly nimble and flexible, his moves vaguely reminiscent of dance techniques.Hazama also knows a Magic Formula which allowed him to summon his fedora out of nowhere, which to him often came in handy whenever he lost it in battle.

Scarlet Magnolia
Scarlet Magnolia is an 18 years former child soldier who is also an orphan, born in Switzerland. She was enlisted in the Schweizer army and fought in the war, where she was treated as nothing more than a weapon because of her phenomenal fighting capabilities. After the war, she was adopted by the Japanese family Saito.
As Scarlet was raised as an orphan child in the army and treated as a mere tool, she didn’t grow up like a regular human being, and did not understand human feelings well. She was raised and grew up as a person who had feelings but couldn't perceive or express them. For this reason, she could be mistaken as emotionless. She also continued to think of herself as a "tool" and believed that it would be appropriate to discard her if she can no longer be used as a weapon. 
However, the one who showed her the life outside of the military was Luca, a Sergeant of the army she was in. He was the one taught Scarlet speech, writing and many other things which made her into a slightly more expressive person. He is a sergeant in the Schweizer army who values Scarlet more than anything, seeing her as a human being rather than a tool. Scarlet and Luca had a very special bond; she treasures Luca very much, which made her want to learn what his words “I love you” truly meant. In doing so, Scarlet made her own decision and followed her own path for the first time in her life.

Rin Akagi
Due to her past experiences, Rin learned to be deceptive and a little manipulative when it comes to social interaction. However, at the same time, she dislikes confrontation from others and becomes aggressive when confronted.
Despite this behavior, she's a very driven and intelligent individual.
Under normal circumstances, she is very composed and reserved during interactions. Befitting her past, Rin believes in the saying "end justifies the means" which implies that any good outcome excuses any wrongs committed to attain said outcome.
Rin is also a mild risk taker, always bracing herself to go through any means necessary to achieve her goals. She opposes and detests the idea of false unification due to her experience being deceived to feel like she belonged somewhere when in truth, she was only being used by the people around her.
